# Greenwood High School Website

Welcome to the official multipage website for Greenwood High School—a responsive, interactive, and production-ready showcase built using semantic HTML5, modular CSS, and accessible JavaScript.

## Purpose

This project simulates a real-world school website, designed to highlight Greenwood High’s academic programs, admissions process, events calendar, and contact information. It demonstrates best practices in frontend development and is structured for scalability and deployment.

## Site Structure

The website includes the following pages:

- **Home (`index.html`)** – Hero section, announcements, quick links, testimonials
- **About (`about.html`)** – School history, mission, leadership
- **Academics (`academics.html`)** – Departments, curriculum, faculty, support services
- **Admissions (`admissions.html`)** – Application process, requirements, downloadable forms
- **Events (`events.html`)** – Upcoming events with category filter and scroll animations
- **Contact (`contact.html`)** – Contact form with validation, school address, and social links

Each page shares a consistent header, footer, and navigation bar for seamless user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Semantic structure and accessibility
- **CSS3** – Responsive layout, grid/flexbox, animations, modular styling
- **JavaScript** – Mobile nav toggle, scroll reveal, form validation, dynamic event filtering
